# AWS-Spot-Instances-And-Price-Prediction-With-Analysis

Cloud cost optimization app for AWS on-demand instances. ML-driven analysis of historical data, region, instance type, and time. Python-Flask web interface with data visualization for informed decisions and efficient cost optimization.

This repository contains an application developed to forecast the best price for on-demand instances in the cloud computing industry, specifically targeting Amazon Web Services (AWS). Cloud services have gained popularity due to their availability, adaptability, and accessibility for managing large volumes of organizational data.

The application leverages historical data analysis and considers factors such as region, instance type, day and time, operating system, and more to predict optimal pricing for on-demand instances. By using machine learning techniques, including regression methods like linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression, the application provides users with valuable insights for cost optimization when utilizing AWS cloud services.

In the cloud computing industry, different types of instances are offered, including on-demand, reserved, and spot instances. On-demand instances provide flexibility but come with high costs, while reserved instances require a one-time fee for committed utilization and offer significant discounts. Spot instances utilize extra capacity and require users to place bids, making them suitable for time-insensitive workloads.

However, due to fluctuating pricing, users often face challenges in determining the optimal bid amount for spot instances. This application aims to address this issue by focusing on forecasting the best price for on-demand instances, helping users make informed decisions.

The application is developed using Python-Flask and offers a web-based interface for easy access and usability. By incorporating regression analysis and machine learning algorithms, users can benefit from accurate price predictions based on historical data and relevant factors.

Overall, this repository provides a practical solution for optimizing costs in cloud computing environments, specifically for AWS users who want to make informed decisions about on-demand instance pricing.
